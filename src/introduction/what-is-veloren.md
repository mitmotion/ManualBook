# What is Veloren?

Veloren is a multiplayer voxel RPG written in [Rust][1]. It is inspired by games such as Cube World,
Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft.

Veloren is fully open-source, licensed under [GPL 3][2]. It uses original graphics, musics and other
assets created by its community. Being contributor-driven, its development community
and user community is one and the same: developers, players, artists and musicians come together
to develop the game.

## What status is the project currently in?

After rewriting the engine from scratch (old game can be found [here][3]) we're now at a stage
where multiple features are introduced quite rapidly.
