# Authentication Server Setup

## Run the authentication server

The Veloren authentication server source code is maintained at: https://gitlab.com/veloren/auth
N.B.: See the [developer](../developers) section for more information on how to compile the source code.

You can then use the `auth-server(.exe)` to get it running.

See also the project [README](https://gitlab.com/veloren/auth/-/blob/master/README.md) for more information on how to deploy the authentication server.

### Server database

The world server executable will use by default the following database file: `/opt/veloren-auth/data/auth.db`.
